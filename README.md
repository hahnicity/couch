A PayPal web framework for slothpal to lounge around on

## Status
Like most of my projects, this has been started but may not be completed
due to changing time schedules, and other interests popping up. However, 
what is in place is:

 * A valid paypal button on the home page for testing out oauth
 * A payments page that will redirect to PayPal OAuth if a session cookie
   is not detected
 * A privacy page
 * A user agreement page.

 These pages are all stubs and should not be expected to be fully built or
 integrated. This project is a stub, but concepts in it can provide the 
 basis for others to get started on their own projects.
